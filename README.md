# Python-Notes-CAPACITI
Week 1-4 Notes

General Overview:
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
Features:
Readability: Python emphasizes code readability and uses indentation instead of braces to define code blocks.
Dynamically Typed: Python is dynamically typed, meaning variable types are determined at runtime.
Interpreted: Python code is executed line by line by the Python interpreter, without the need for compilation.
Extensive Standard Library: Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides modules and packages for various tasks.
Cross-platform: Python code can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Data Structures:
Python provides built-in data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and more.
Lists are ordered, mutable collections of elements.
Tuples are ordered, immutable collections of elements.
Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs.
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.
Control Flow:
Python supports conditional statements (if, elif, else) and loop constructs (for, while).
Loop control statements include break, continue, and pass.
Functions:
Functions in Python are defined using the def keyword.
They can accept parameters and return values.
Python also supports lambda functions for creating anonymous functions.
Modules and Packages:
Python code can be organized into modules, which are files containing Python code.
Modules can be grouped into packages, which are directories containing modules with a special __init__.py file.
Packages can be installed using the pip package manager, which comes with Python by default.
Object-Oriented Programming:
Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Classes are blueprints for creating objects, and objects are instances of classes.
Inheritance allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes.
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
Exception Handling:
Python provides a robust mechanism for handling exceptions using try, except, finally, and raise statements.
Exception handling helps in gracefully handling runtime errors and preventing program crashes.
File Handling:
Python supports file I/O operations for reading from and writing to files.
File objects are created using the built-in open () function, and operations such as reading, writing, and closing files can be performed using file methods.
Popular Libraries and Frameworks:
Python has a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks for various domains such as web development, data science, machine learning, and more.
Some popular libraries include NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Flask, Django, and scikit-learn.
